1. /storage/PMIinDriFuzz/config/fuzzer/syzkaller/pci/device.json
    I found that the number of "QEMU Devices" in final.json matched the claim "Moreover, PrIntFuzz could simulate 311(=281+30) PCI devices
 in total based on QEMU" in paper, and actually what they did in code is listing all qemu emulated devices, analysing the linux driver,
 if the driver match the qemu device driver, then mark it as qemu support driver, then when evaluate the system, they pass this device as arg to qemu command.
    Actually when I find the qemu emulated device list, ant it has a attribute named "driver", I can directly use it instead trace the code.

   the .config file in guest_kernel after executed make defconfig / make kvm_guest.config
