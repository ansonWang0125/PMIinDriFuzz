1/12: Check with professor: 
    I have read the "recent_paper" and "agamotto" again,
    I want to build a OS-agnostic and fuzzer-agnostic tools leverage the Intel hardware (PMI),
    but Intel PMI can't knowning the address base of current task,
    causing lots of profile data generated,
    the Intel PT can knows the address base,
    can we leverage the Intel PT to tell us the address base,
    and using PMI as a lightweight tools to collect profiling data (compare to Intel PT),
    and using the data to accelerate driver fuzzing (as perf did in user space).
1/21: Check with professor:
    Before the end of February: Complete profiling data collection.
    Before the end of April: Create a training procedure.
    Before the end of June: Complete checkpoint policy data collection.
    Before the end of August: Integrate checkpoint acceleration and PMI acceleration.
    Before the end of October: Complete full project.
    Before the end of this year: Complete my paper!! Congratulation!
