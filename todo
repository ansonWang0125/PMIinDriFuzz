1/9 TODO-L2: Arm seems have used PMI for profiling there test program to test the hardware performance, try to find it.
1/9 TODO-L2: Find the position for PMI in kernel fuzzing, what it can do and what it can't do.
1/13 TODO-L3: How cmake works? how cmake knows underlining build system, find the basic usage of cmake.
1/13 TODO-L3: Why we use ninja?
1/13 TODO-L4: Check build-env/ install only install all we needed.
1/13 TODO-L4: Check every setting in env.sh is needed, I copy and paste from agamotto repo now.
1/13 TODO-L4: Write a script to modify grub config for changing host kernel.
1/13 TODO-L4: Find the dependency control for taskfile.
1/13 TODO-L3: Rust seems build program totally based on logic, try to learn it.
1/13 TODO-L4: Update file structure in ReadMe.md.
1/13 TODO-L4: The syzkaller version agamotto based on is before golang introdue go module, so we can't independently compile a dependency repo, for now I add go as submodule, but we need to find a way to compile syzkaller.
1/13 TODO-L4: .bashrc can't effected in current shell by using taskfile, find a way to do it.
1/14 TODO-L3: What is user "nobody"?
1/14 TODO-L4: Why PrIntFuzz has "drivers" field in enable_syscalls setting in syz manager config? The config document said "enable_syscall" should be a list of string.
1/15 TODO-L4: Integrate string const seperated in python code to env package. 
1/16 TODO-L3: The c compiler mechanism, how the initcall implemented.
1/16 TODO-L4: Find a way to run setup command in vm, run the script in scripts/sh/vm/setup.sh
1/16 TODO-L4: What is qemu object? what is it use for?
1/17 TODO-L3: Find a good way to compile multiple file for userspace agent
1/18 TODO-L2: How git submodule work internally?
1/21 TODO-L4: What the different between json.dumps and json.dump
1/22 TODO-L3: What is fuse? how mount in kernel work, and what are the functionalities provided by daemon and how did it works?
1/24 TODO-L4: Perf data log flows from PMI handler in kernel to sample handler in userspace to host consumer still need more fluent.
1/25 TODO-L1: syz-executor need to enable perf and record the perf data to shared memory, but our goal is fuzzer agnostic, so the ideal way is using ptrace to intercept all syscall then enable perf functionality. Now we call the perf lib in shared_fs to record syscall perf data.
1/26 TODO-L1: Make sure our perf_lib contains only generic code, because it should be executed in guest VM.
1/27 TODO-L3: I am reading "UIO: user-space drivers", what is char driver and what is user-space block, and how DMA works, what is GPL's kernel.
1/27 TODO-L3: How "insmod" work in kernel.
1/28 TODO-L4: What is MAB algorithm. What is EcoFuzz
