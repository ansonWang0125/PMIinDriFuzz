1/9:
    1. Initialize the project repository.
    2. Run the PrIntFuzz.
    3. Resolve the dependency bug (incompatible problem in compiler version and cmake version) in PrIntFuzz
    4. Find the config of guest kernel and syzkaller for PCI.
1/10:
    1. Adjust the config of guest kernel and syzkaller to fit our project.
    2. Complete enable_config / printfuzz_get utils
1/11:
    1. Find the emulated device for PCI
    2. Complete qemu command genrator
    3. Complete kernel compile scripts
1/12:
    1. Complete bootstrap script.
    2. Read the first three page of Agamotto paper.
    3. Read the Git document for git submodule, try to build host kernel.
1/13:
    1. Build host kernel
    2. Build guest kernel
    3. Build qemu
    4. Build syzkaller
1/14:
    1. Writing a script for replacing config template!
1/15:
    1. Run the syzkaller, check everything works fine.
1/16:
    1. I found that I am totally wrong to write Perf data to shared memory in guest kernel, It should be the job of guest agent.
    2. Checked the qemu, syzkaller and kernel works fine.
1/17:
    1. Write user agent to obtain LBR sample data from mmap
1/18:
    1. Write perf info to shared memory
1/19:
    1. Building shared memory structure.
1/20:
    1. Complete share memory structure.
    2. Research the relationship between enabled syscall and qemu emulated device in PrIntFuzz project.
1/21:
    1. Get the qemu emulated device list from printfuzz project, knows that which syscalls and devices need to fuzz a driver

DAILY_TODO:
    1. Perf data log flows from PMI handler in kernel to sample handler in userspace to host consumer still need more fluent.
    2. Clarify "sound" or "net" is the driver type or device type in printfuzz project.
