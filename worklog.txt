1/9:
    1. Initialize the project repository.
    2. Run the PrIntFuzz.
    3. Resolve the dependency bug (incompatible problem in compiler version and cmake version) in PrIntFuzz
    4. Find the config of guest kernel and syzkaller for PCI.
1/10:
    1. Adjust the config of guest kernel and syzkaller to fit our project.
    2. Complete enable_config / printfuzz_get utils
1/11:
    1. Find the emulated device for PCI
    2. Complete qemu command genrator
    3. Complete kernel compile scripts
1/12:
    1. Complete bootstrap script.
    2. Read the first three page of Agamotto paper.
    3. Read the Git document for git submodule, try to build host kernel.
1/13:
    1. Build host kernel
    2. Build guest kernel
    3. Build qemu
    4. Build syzkaller

1/14:
    1. Writing a script for replacing config template!
1/15:
    1. Run the syzkaller, check everything works fine.
1/16:
    1. I found that I am totally wrong to write Perf data to shared memory in guest kernel, It should be the job of guest agent.
    2. Checked the qemu, syzkaller and kernel works fine.

DAILY_TODO:
    1. We need to manual port PMI work in syzkaller
    2. Check LBR successfully recorded, if not, fix it.
    3. Test LBR (PMI) work properly (frequency test), if not, fix it.
    4. Check how Intel PT set address base, can we leverage it?
    5. Read Agamotto Paper.
    6. Read Intel PT Paper.
    7. Read Other Paper.
    8. Write a userspace agent to mmap perf data, then write to shared memory.
